1. Product Overview
JamTab is a mobile app (iOS & Android) that uses AI to transcribe audio or video into tablature, chord progressions, and rhythm patterns. It supports beginner, intermediate, and advanced difficulty modes, offers practice tools like slow-down, looping, chunking, and reverse playback, and now includes song form detection (ABA, AABB, ABCABA, etc.) to show how the chord progression fits into the songâ€™s structure.

Ultimate tool for shedding music.

2. Goals & Objectives
Provide highly accurate AI-driven transcription for solos, chords, and rhythms.

Display song structure labels for better learning and arrangement understanding.

Allow musicians to practice efficiently with advanced playback controls.

Remain genre-agnostic while giving Bluegrass-specific support.

3. Target Audience
Musicians of all skill levels

Bluegrass jammers & acoustic players

Music teachers & students

Transcribers & arrangers

- Supported scales (initial): Minor Pentatonic, Major Pentatonic, Mixolydian, Dorian, Aeolian, Blues.
- Difficulty modes:
  - Beginner: show 1-2 safe options (usually pentatonic + blues when applicable).
  - Intermediate: add modal options (mixolydian over dominant, dorian over minor ii, aeolian for vi, etc.).
  - Advanced: include chord-tone targets, avoid notes, and passing tones per bar.
- Instrument-aware patterns: fretboard/position suggestions based on tuning and difficulty.
- Playback sync: highlight current sectionâ€™s recommended scale and target tones as audio plays.
- Output: JSON with per-section and per-chord `key_center`, `recommended_scales`, `scale_degrees`, and `target_notes`.

4.10 Key Transpose While Practicing (NEW)
Allow users to change the playback key without re-uploading, for comfortable singing/playing and exploring tonalities.

- Real-time or near-real-time pitch shift of audio/video by Â±12 semitones.
- Auto-transpose displayed chords, Tennessee numbers, and tablature to the selected key.
- Show capo suggestion for string instruments after transposition.
- Preserve tempo (independent of existing slow-down feature).
